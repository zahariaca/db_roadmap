## Usage of Milestone 1 app

When launching the application, add as Program Arguments the following: `-m file`. This is REQUIRED

The paths of persistence files can be changed with Program Arguments, e.g: `-p persistence/products.json -u persistence/users.json -t persistence/transactions.json`.
If not provided, default values for these files will be used.

Currently there is no way to add users, `-u persistence/users.json` should be the provided one, otherwise there will be no supplier users.
